0 london heathrow to cork. what a disappointment! after travelling half way around the world, being exposed to some super airport and inflight service, to finish our journey on our own countries carrier aer lingus, should have been great, how wrong we were. staff at the check in desk chewing gum and dressed scruffy set the tone, very poor. called to check in and then made stand for 40 minutes just past the check in desk?  why check in passengers and make them stand in a small area, when the plane hasn't disembarked it's previous passengers? this shows a total lack of regard for the elderly, people not in full health and people completing long journeys. after 40 minutes of standing we went back past the check in area to the seats so the kids could sit comfortably and complained to aer lingus staff, not that they seemed to care as they were to interested in chatting amongst themselves. and why does it take 6 staff to check in a small plane?  unfortunately things on the plane weren't much better, poorly dressed staff looking tired and rough, we couldn't understand the lady on the mic reading the safety statement, neither could the girl demonstrating this as they were in and out of sync, lack of professional refreshment service provided as the first thing they were asked for off the menu seemed to confuse the stewardess and she dissappeared for a while and returned with a no we don't have that. it was only a sandwich that was requested by another passenger. obviously there are good staff with aer lingus also, but this is spoilt by a poor few and bad practices. i would recommend management in aer lingus should get on a singapore airlines flight to see how it should be done, very well dressed staff throughout a long flight, very attentive and polite to any need or request, each one of them asked the name of our kids and used it when talking to them (aer lingus staff didn't bother to ask, the chewing gum was obviously in the way), very well organised at check in time even though dealing with a great deal more passengers and it didn't take six of them to do it either! come on aer lingus staff you can do much better than this, and it wouldn't take much, just a better regard for your customers and some manners.

0 prague to toronto. violin cruise line booked my sister and me on air canada from prague to toronto. little did i know that the flight was on air canada rouge that doesn't have movies/headphone jacks and expects one to know that one must fly with their own ipad and headphones plus download the air canada app prior to takeoff. they mention downloading the app but i did not realise it is mandatory to do so to be able to watch movies on one's cell phone or ipad until one is in the air and it is too late! (unless you wish to rent their ipad). it was nearly 9 hours in a seat that did not recline with discount beverages and lousy meals.

0 without question this is the worst long haul flight i have ever taken. i couldn’t believe that for 11 hours we were confined to the limited legroom of a 737. was the 737 designed for long haul? the first leg of the overnight flight, from vancouver to halifax, didn’t serve a meal, but put out the lights and expected us to sleep. during the night we were hungry and thirsty, and had to go to the galley and ask for refreshments. thank goodness we managed to buy a decent breakfast at halifax airport! then back onto another 737 for the second leg of the flight. the meal offered was small and fairly tasteless (i think the worst i have ever experienced on long haul), and again the need to visit the galley to stay hydrated. the overhead lockers were absolutely jam packed by the time we got seated, and i ended up putting my rucksack under the seat, eating into my already limited legroom. it’s almost impossible to compare air canada with other carriers which i use for long haul e.g. ba, thai, malaysian, cathay, emirates, where the passenger is kept fed and hydrated by attentive staff. when i arrived at heathrow i took two flights to reach home in northern scotland- with ba and loganair. each flight was less than an hour and had i more room and comfort than crossing the atlantic!

0 air canada rouge has got to be the worst airline that we have flown. we flew from vancouver to honolulu on a b767 aircraft. it was a very old airplane and a very dirty one too. such neglect is simply unacceptable in the 21st century. a very bad image for the mother company indeed. i understand that it is a cheaper airline but still they have to do something about cleanliness. nevertheless, i have to say that cabin crew was very polite and professional.

0 london gatwick to toronto with air canada rouge during august 2016. this was a very poor flight. there many faults. first, there was no inflight entertainment at all. we were told that there was inflight wifi but this did not work. very disappointing on such a long flight. the food was also poor and the announcements on the tannoy system were frequently inaudible. but by far, the worst aspect of the flight was the very limited legroom available. i am over 6' tall, and i struggled to find a comfortable position throughout this flight. on a long 8 hour flight i would have expected more room. i have flown many times with other carriers and have had adequate leg room on longer flights. i have also sometimes flown on short european low cost airline carriers with more legroom than this, and they are much cheaper carriers. what is surprising is that we flew a much shorter connecting flight (just over 4 hours) from toronto to victoria bc with air canada and had all the facilities that i described above. so why did air canada rouge not provide a better service for the much longer leg of the journey? i don't like to sound so negative and would not give negative feedback easily but this carrier were very poor value for money.

0 very frustrating experience with air canada. overbooked, assigned seats separately and not able to change that to have seats together. crew was not helpful and very irritated, makes you feel sorry that you asked anything. after continuous delays, when we finally started disembarkation the crew was very eager to leave the plane and rushed us in a rude manner.

0 plane was tired but clean, staff were dreadful. saw the staff with a meal at the beginning of the night flight and then again at breakfast time before landing. no drinks even water offered through the night. family with two year old twins behind me, never witnessed any help or a reassuring word offered to them. the staff didn’t really have a pleasant word for anyone. went to the toilet in the night and it was awful, smelt and the seat was very dirty, needed checking a little more often. breakfast was a brown paper bag with a croissant and plain yoghurt, the croissant was so cold it really was inedible, so as you might have gathered we won’t be flying air canada again

0 flew toronto to phoenix, az. while the seats were very tight with hardly any leg room, my biggest disappointment was with the baggage. i purposely packed carry-on so i could avoid checking a bag. however when we got to the gate, they asked people to check bags as it was a full flight and ensured us that we would get them off first (along with getting seated prior to economy boarding). those of us checking our bags were told to leave them in the 'tunnel' just before getting on the plane. when we arrived in phoenix, none of the bags that were checked last minute made it onto the plane. the air canada agent that was at the baggage claim in phoenix was very inconsiderate and repeatedly told us to wait (even though we had all been waiting over an hour at this point). we all filled out forms for our bags to be delivered to our destinations. very disappointed with air canada rouge.

0 sunday 21st june, shanghai to mexico city premier class. old aircraft with no inflight entertainment this situation bother me so much. there was also a complete lack of interest shown by the cabin crew in their jobs. very disappointing. the flying experience was not be very good on premier class after i bought an upgrade from  economy class. 

1 super convenient 3 pm departure from delhi. only direct flight from delhi to madrid. excellent legroom in economy class - more than any other long-haul airline i have been on. adequate film choices in english. decent meal, wholesome snack - more substantive than ana which i flew to tokyo from delhi last month. absolutely nothing wrong in traveling this airline. asked for a gin and tonic, got two without asking. just don't understand why people criticize this airline so much. it's my preferred choice in economy when possible.

1 cabin crew took care of me from prague to paris cdg and they were speaking very well english. gate agent has kindly provided me my luggage tag number. i would probably continue to fly with air france. next trip will be through amsterdam to bordeaux and i hope it will be fine. i've never been there but i'm optimistic. recommendation: i will definitely appreciate if they can change the coffee offered on board.

1 just flew from lax to akl on anz in business class. it is what business class should be like. very attentive staff although the food is getting a bit downgraded and staff at the lax lounge are just okay i think the majority of staff are now subcontractors so do not have the kiwi values except for long term staff. air nz needs to be careful not to try and squeeze out too much profit yet is still offers one of the best business classes in the field. just fly ual from sydney and see how they have not really upped their game. i wish they would match airnz.

1 flight nz 8046 christchurch to wellington 19 march 2014. our flight yesterday went beyond just "good service" it was excellent service. this is not necessarily because anything out of the ordinary happened on our flight but rather because our air new zealand pilots and cabin attendant just did the ordinary things particularly well. no fuss no bother just professionalism. we felt comfortable happy and safe and when it is all said and done that's why one chooses to fly with a particular airline.
